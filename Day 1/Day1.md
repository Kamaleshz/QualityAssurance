## Software Testing
It is part of Software development helps to 
- acheive quality assurance
- meet requirements
- produce Bug - free

## Validation and Verification

Verification : are we building the right product. For example we order a cake and verify it by seeing whether the color is same, toppings and smells good.

Like Code review, documents, design on a specific requirement.fixing is easy and low cost

Validation : are we build the correct product. Eating cake to ensure it taste well

Checking where what we agree (customer requirement) and what er build are same and fixing here is costly and time consuming because we baked a cake with blueberry apperance but with velvet taste

## Principle of software Testing

1. Exhaustive test is not possible example: there are lot of test scenerio in moving a file from one directory to another.we can't test everything

1. Defect Clustering : We need to choose the module which will result in large defect. It come by experience

1. Pesticide paradox : we need to alter and review the test case periodically to identify defect in the application ( same pesticide in farm create immunity to insects)

1. Testing shows presence of defect : if testing doesn't give bugs or defect it doesn't mean that application is correct and bug free

1. Absence of error : if we work hard and test our application to 99% but the application doesn't meet requirement is useless

1. Early testing : start to test at the time of requirement itself.

1. Test is context dependent : changes project to project.
